1: implement basic in-built terminal, for debugging during early start-up (DONE)
2: implement scheduler, context-handling, syscals
3: implement ramfs, procfs,...
4: implement a tty binder
5: build a separate terminal, which connects to the tty
6: somehow launch this as (first) task and let it launch other tasks
