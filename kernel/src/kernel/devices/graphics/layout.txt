Global FB, wrapped by some kind of manager file at /proc/gfx/fb (or similar)
may be written to using write() (at offset), where offset is the offset into the framebuffer. the written bytes must respect pitch, bpp, ...
This is used internal for all fb write operations.
User processes (handled by libtinygraphics) can instead (to avoid excessive syscalls) mmap their own temporary framebuffer and write to it normally.
once this is done N flushes may be done, flushing buffers of length L_i at offsets O_i into the global framebuffer
